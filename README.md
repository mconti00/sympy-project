# SymPy

- SymPy is a Python library for symbolic computation: it provides tools for symbolic algebra, calculus and equation solving.
- This project focuses on the role of SymPy in solving Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) in physics. 

## Installation 

### for pip users
- To install SymPy using 'pip', make sure you have Python installed. 
- Then, open your terminal or command propt and run the following command:

```bash
pip install sympy
```

### for Conda users
- If you prefer using conda, you can install SymPy using the Anaconda or Miniconda package manager.
- Open your command prompt and create a new conda environment, activate it and install SymPy:
```bash
conda create -n my-env
conda activate my-env
install sympy
```

## Overview
- Under the file "1_sympy_documentation.txt" you may find an explanation of the SymPy functions and capabilities that we will cover in this session.
- "2_sympy_examples.py" contains a few physics-related problems solved with the said functions.
- Finally, after the presentation, you may open "3_class_exercise.py", in which you may find the problem to be solved (check "3_class_exercise_sols.py" for the solutions)
