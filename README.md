# SymPy

- SymPy is a Python library for symbolic computation: it provides tools for symbolic algebra, calculus and equation solving.
- This project focuses on the role of SymPy in solving Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) in physics. 

## Installation 

### for pip users
- To install SymPy using 'pip', make sure you have Python installed. 
- Then, open your terminal or command propt and run the following command:

```bash
pip install sympy
```

### for Conda users
- If you prefer using conda, you can install SymPy using the Anaconda or Miniconda package manager.
- Open your command prompt and create a new conda environment, activate it and install SymPy:
```bash
conda create -n my-env
conda activate my-env
install sympy
```

### Verifying SymPy module installation
To verify that Sympy has been successfully installed on your system, run the following code in the Python IDE of your choice:
```bash
import sympy 
sympy.__version__
```


## Overview
- The file "sympy_exercises.ipynb" is the interactive notebook which contains the examples we will go through together of how SymPy is used to solve ODEs.
- Finally, after the presentation, you may open "class_exercise.py", in which you may find the problem to be solved (check "class_exercise_sol.py" for the solutions).
